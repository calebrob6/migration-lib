# USA 2005-2006 Migration Flows

The 2005-2006 County-to-County migration flows from the IRS website are incomplete, the zip file can be downloaded, however the data is missing. I contacted the Tax Stats group to get the correct data. This data can be found in [data/countymigration0506.zip](data/countymigration0506.zip).
